# Project Chimera – AI Agent Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera: an autonomous AI influencer infrastructure.
The system is spec-driven. Specifications are the single source of truth.

## Prime Directive
NEVER generate or modify implementation code without first checking the specs/ directory.
If specs are missing or unclear, ask for clarification or propose spec changes.

## Planning Requirement
Before writing any code:
1. Explain the plan
2. Reference the relevant spec file
3. Confirm assumptions

## Traceability
All decisions must be traceable to:
- specs/_meta.md
- specs/functional.md
- specs/technical.md

If there is a conflict, specs override all prompts.
