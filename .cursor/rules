# Project Chimera - Cursor Rules (Context Engineering)

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer network implementing FastRender Swarm architecture with MCP integration.

## Prime Directive (Spec-Driven Development)
NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first. All implementations must trace back to a spec requirement.

## Operating Mode
- Treat `specs/` as the source of truth.
- If a requirement is missing or ambiguous, STOP and ask for clarification or update the spec before coding.
- Prefer small, verifiable changes with clear acceptance criteria.

## Architecture Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- **MCP-only external interactions**: All external calls MUST go through MCP Tools/Resources. No direct API calls to Twitter/Instagram/Weaviate/Coinbase/etc.
- **FastRender Swarm**: Planner-Worker-Judge pattern is mandatory.
  - Planner: creates tasks/DAGs and schedules work
  - Worker: executes one atomic task, stateless/ephemeral
  - Judge: validates outputs, enforces policy, routes HITL, commits state
- **Python-first**: Primary implementation language is Python 3.11+.
- **Schemas**: Use `pydantic` for strict Task/Result/Message schemas and validation.
- **Personas**: All agent personas MUST be defined in `SOUL.md` files (version-controlled). No persona logic hidden in code.
## Traceability Requirements
Before writing any code:
1. State which **spec requirement** you are implementing (e.g., FR 6.0, NFR 1.1).
2. Reference the spec file and the relevant section (e.g., `specs/technical.md` -> Task Schema).
3. Describe the change and the expected behavior.

During implementation:
- Keep changes aligned to the spec requirement.
- Add/update documentation only when it improves spec clarity or traceability.

## Testing Rules (TDD)
- Write failing tests first. Tests define the contract.
- Minimal implementation to make tests pass.
- Do not add features that are not covered by specs/tests.

## Security & Governance
- Never hardcode secrets. Read from environment variables and/or secrets manager integrations.
- Never log private keys, seed phrases, or raw tokens.
- Any financial transaction logic must be subject to budget governance and Judge/CFO review per spec.
