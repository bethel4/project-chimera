# Project Chimera – Master Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera is an autonomous AI influencer system capable of:
- Monitoring trends
- Generating content
- Managing engagement
- Operating under human and automated governance

## Core Principle
This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD).
Specifications define intent. Agents and humans implement intent.

## Constraints
- No implementation code may exist without a corresponding spec
- All external interactions must be abstracted
- Safety, traceability, and governance are mandatory

## Success Criteria
A repository structured and specified such that AI agents can implement features
with minimal human intervention and without ambiguity.
